# Task Application Web Application

As a software engineer i want to be able make software that empowers and people to stay on top everyday activities.
This is Task application. What you can do with this web app is that you can organize your tasks, appointments or assignments. 

The reason why i built this application is that I wannted to be able to track my assignments and also write notes if there is special consideration I should take when doing those assignments.
